# RigDebugger
Debugging and Development tools for creating rigs in Blender 2.8

Intended for riggers to use to easily develop rigs in Blender 2.8.

Will add a Panel in the 3D Viewport, with different operators for mirroring, selecting, and printing useful information about the bones and the armature rig.
